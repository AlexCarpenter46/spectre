 * \brief The type of boundary condition.
 *
 * There are generally two categories or types of boundary conditions. Those
 * that:
 *
 * 1. set up additional cells or elements (called ghost cells or ghost elements)
 *    outside the computational domain and then apply boundary corrections the
 *    same way that is done in the the interior. For example, in a discontinuous
 *    Galerkin scheme these would impose boundary conditions through a numerical
 *    flux boundary correction term.
 *
 * 2. change the time derivatives at the external boundary
