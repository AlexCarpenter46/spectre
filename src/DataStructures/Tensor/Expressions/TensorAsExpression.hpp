/// \brief Given a tensor symmetry and the positions of indices where a generic
/// spatial index is used for a spacetime index and the positions where a
/// concrete time index is used, this returns the symmetry after making those
/// indices nonsymmetric with others that do not do the same
///
/// \details
/// Example: Let `symmetry` be `{1, 2, 2, 2, 1}`. Let
/// `spatial_spacetime_index_positions` be `{1, 2}`: the 2nd and 3rd indices
/// of the tensor are spacetime indices where a generic spatial index is used.
/// Let `time_index_positions` be `{4}`: the 5th (last) index is a spacetime
/// index where a concrete time index is used. The resulting symmetry will
/// reflect that the 2nd and 3rd indices are still symmetric with each other,
/// but no longer symmetric with the 4th index, and the 5th index will no
/// longer be symmetric with the 1st index. Therefore, the returned symmetry
/// will be equivalent to the form of `{4, 3, 3, 2, 1}`.
///
/// Note: the symmetry returned by this function is not necessarily in the
/// canonical form specified by ::Symmetry. For example, the actual array
/// returned in the example above is `{1, 4, 4, 2, 5}`. As such, this array
/// still encodes which indices are symmetric, but it is not in the canonical
/// form specified by ::Symmetry, which is `{4, 3, 3, 2, 1}`.
///
/// \param symmetry the input tensor symmetry to transform
/// \param spatial_spacetime_index_positions the positions of the indices of the
/// tensor where a generic spatial index is used for a spacetime index
/// \param time_index_positions the positions of the indices of the tensor where
/// a concrete time index is used for a spacetime index
/// \return the symmetry after making the `spatial_spacetime_index_positions`
/// and `time_index_positions` of `symmetry` nonsymmetric with indices at other

/// \brief Helper struct for computing the new canonical symmetry of a tensor
/// after generic spatial indices are used for any of the tensor's spacetime
/// indices
///
/// \details This is relevant in cases where a tensor has spacetime indices that
/// are symmetric but generic spatial indices are used for a non-empty subset of
/// those symmetric spacetime indices. For example, if we have some rank 3
/// tensor with the first index being spatial and the 2nd and third indices
/// spacetime and symmetric, but a generic spatial index is used for the 2nd
/// index, the "result" of the single tensor expression, \f$R_{ija}\f$, is a
/// rank 3 tensor whose 2nd and 3rd indices are no longer symmetric.

/// Given that some `Tensor` named `R` that represents the tensor in the above
/// example, the symmetry of the `Tensor` is `[2, 1, 1]`, but the computed
/// symmetry of the `TensorAsExpression` that represents it will have symmetry
/// `[3, 2, 1]` to reflect this loss of symmetry.
///
/// Evaluating the "result" symmetry here in `TensorAsExpression`, at the leaves
/// of the expression tree, enables the propagation of this symmetry up the tree
/// to the other expression types. By determining each tensor's "result"
/// symmetry at the leaves, the expressions at internal nodes of the tree can
/// have their individual symmetries determined without having to each consider
/// whether their operand(s) are expression(s) that have spacetime indices where
/// generic spatial indices were used.
